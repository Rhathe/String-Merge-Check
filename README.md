Program asks for a file consisting of a list of strings as input and a file name to output to when started. The third string is checked to see if it is a merge of the previous two strings using DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING! If it is, it weites to the output file a string where the lowercase letters correspond to the second string and the uppercase letters correspond to the first string. Else it outputs *NOT A MERGE*.
